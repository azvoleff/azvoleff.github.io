I am a researcher with the [Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) 
Network](http://www.teamnetwork.org), based at [Conservation 
International](http://www.conservation.org).

I work on land use and land cover change, using a mixture of remote sensing, 
spatial modeling and statistics, and social survey techniques to investigate 
relationships between human and environmental change.
