I am Senior Director of Data Science in the Moore Center for Science at 
Conservation International.

I work on problems at the intersection of climate, population, and land use and 
land cover change research, using a mixture of remote sensing, spatial modeling 
and statistics, and social survey techniques to investigate relationships 
between human and environmental change.
