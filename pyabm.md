## An Open Source Agent-based Modeling Toolkit
PyABM is an open source (GPL licensed) toolkit aiming to simplify the 
programming and analysis of agent-based models written in the
[Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. The toolkit aims to 
standardize model and scenario development, ensuring documentation and
repeatability of model results.

PyABM was originally developed to facilitate running the 
[ChitwanABM](/chitwanabm) agent based model. Development of the ChitwanABM is 
complete, and future work on the PyABM toolkit is currently on hold (as of 
March 2014).

Please feel free to contact me with any questions about using the toolkit.
