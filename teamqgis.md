## Overview

`teamqgis`Â is a [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](http://www.qgis.org/) plugin to support 
digitizing training and validation data from remote sensing imagery. The plugin 
was created to support the work of the [Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring 
(TEAM) Network](http://www.teamnetwork.org). The TEAM Network is a global 
network of sites in tropical forests focused on collecting standardized 
real-time data measuring the response of tropical forests to changing climate, 
land cover and land use, and population.

`teamqgis` is based off of the 
[itembrowser](http://3nids.github.io/itembrowser) plugin created by Denis 
Rouzaud.

The latest version of the plugin is available on [the QGIS Python Plugins Repository](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/teamqgis).

The development version of the plugin is available on 
[github](https://github.com/azvoleff/teamqgis).

For more information, also see the [README 
file](https://raw.github.com/azvoleff/teamqgis/master/README.md) and 
[changelog](https://raw.github.com/azvoleff/teamqgis/master/CHANGELOG.md).
