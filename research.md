## Research Interests
* Land-use and land-cover change
* Population, health, and environment approaches to conservation
* Feedbacks between climate variability and change and human systems
* Methodologies for studying coupled human-environment systems

## Current Work
I am working with the [Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) 
Network](http://teamnetwork.org) on a project investigating the effects of 
climate change and land use and cover change around tropical protected areas on 
biodiversity. We are linking species data from plot and camera trap monitoring 
to satellite observations to study linkages between land cover change and 
biodiversity.

Below are several ongoing projects related to TEAM.

#### teamlucc
[teamlucc](/teamlucc) is an R package to support the preprocessing and 
classification of satellite imagery for biodiversity monitoring and land cover 
change modeling.

#### glcm
[glcm](/glcm) is an R package for calculating image textures measures derived 
from grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM).

#### gfcanalysis
[gfcanalysis](/gfcanalysis) is an R package to facilitate analyses using the [Global 
Forest Change 
dataset](http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest) 
released devolped by [Hansen et al. 
(2013)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850).

## Past Research

<a name='PyABM'>

### PyABM
An [open-source agent-based model toolkit](/pyabm) written in Python.

<a name='ChitwanABM'>

### ChitwanABM
[ChitwanABM](/chitwanabm) is an agent-based model of the western Chitwan 
Valley, Nepal, used to explore connections between population and environment.

### Land Use and Cover Change in the Chitwan Valley, Nepal
Worked with [Dr. Li An](http://geography.sdsu.edu/People/Faculty/an.html) on an 
[NSF PIRE project](http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu) exploring human-environment 
interactions in the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal. In order to better 
incorporate feedbacks between fertility and environmental change, we 
constructed an agent-based model of population at the individual, household, 
and neighborhood levels, and modeled interactions between demographic change 
and land use change. Our research using a spatially explicit agent-based model 
allows a better representation of spatial variation in the determinants of land 
use, as well as of the spatial distribution of land use change, which may be an 
important determinant of habitat quality in the forest areas surrounding the 
study area.

[PyABM](#PyABM) and [ChitwanABM](#ChitwanABM) are both outcomes of this 
project.

### Health, Poverty, and Place in Accra, Ghana
I was also a part of a team working on a NIH funded project in Accra, Ghana ["Health, 
Poverty, and Place in Accra, 
Ghana"](http://geography.sdsu.edu/Research/Projects/IPC/research/accra.html), (PI
[Dr. John Weeks](http://geography.sdsu.edu/People/Faculty/weeks.html)), to 
explore relationships between neighborhood context and health outcomes.

### Rural Energy Infrastructure
Studied the impact of population distribution in rural areas on the costs of 
infrastructure investment. With [Dr. Vijay Modi](http://modi.mech.columbia.edu) 
of Columbia University.

### Climate System Dynamics
Constructed an agent-based model examining dynamics of coupled human-climate 
system over long timescales. With [Dr. Brad 
Werner](http://complex-systems.ucsd.edu) of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography.
