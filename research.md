## Research Interests
* Interactions among climate, land use and land cover change, and livelihoods
* Methods and tools for integrating social and biophysical datasets to inform 
  conservation
* Modeling and data visualization

## Short Bio
I am Senior Director of Resilience Science in the Moore Center for Science at 
Conservation International. I lead research on the role of nature in supporting 
climate resilience, pathways for transformative adaptation to climate change, 
and the development of new methods and tools that integrate large 
interdisciplinary datasets to study interactions among climate, land use and 
land cover change, and human-wellbeing. My work uses statistics and spatial 
modeling to assimilate data from a broad range of sources to ensure the best 
possible information is available, and accessible by non-expert audiences, to 
inform conservation decisions. I received my Ph.D. in geography in a joint 
program at San Diego State University and the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, and have a masterâ€™s from Columbia University.

## Past Research

### TEAM
I worked with the [Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) 
Network](http://teamnetwork.org) on a project investigating the effects of 
climate change and land use and cover change around tropical protected areas on 
biodiversity. We linked species data from plot and camera trap monitoring to 
satellite observations to study linkages between land cover change and 
biodiversity.

### teamlucc

[teamlucc](/teamlucc) is an R package to support the preprocessing and 
classification of satellite imagery for biodiversity monitoring and land cover 
change modeling.

### glcm

[glcm](/glcm) is an R package for calculating image textures measures derived 
from grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM).

### gfcanalysis
[gfcanalysis](/gfcanalysis) is an R package to facilitate analyses using the [Global 
Forest Change 
dataset](http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest) 
released devolped by [Hansen et al. 
(2013)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850).

<a name='PyABM'>

### PyABM

An [open-source agent-based model toolkit](/pyabm) written in Python.

<a name='ChitwanABM'>

### ChitwanABM

[ChitwanABM](/chitwanabm) is an agent-based model of the western Chitwan 
Valley, Nepal, used to explore connections between population and environment.

### Land Use and Cover Change in the Chitwan Valley, Nepal

Worked with [Dr. Li An](http://geography.sdsu.edu/People/Faculty/an.html) on an 
[NSF PIRE project](http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu) exploring human-environment 
interactions in the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal. In order to better 
incorporate feedbacks between fertility and environmental change, we 
constructed an agent-based model of population at the individual, household, 
and neighborhood levels, and modeled interactions between demographic change 
and land use change. Our research using a spatially explicit agent-based model 
allows a better representation of spatial variation in the determinants of land 
use, as well as of the spatial distribution of land use change, which may be an 
important determinant of habitat quality in the forest areas surrounding the 
study area.

[PyABM](#PyABM) and [ChitwanABM](#ChitwanABM) are both outcomes of this 
project.

### Health, Poverty, and Place in Accra, Ghana
I was also a part of a team working on a NIH funded project in Accra, Ghana ["Health, 
Poverty, and Place in Accra, 
Ghana"](http://geography.sdsu.edu/Research/Projects/IPC/research/accra.html), (PI
[Dr. John Weeks](http://geography.sdsu.edu/People/Faculty/weeks.html)), to 
explore relationships between neighborhood context and health outcomes.

### Rural Energy Infrastructure
Studied the impact of population distribution in rural areas on the costs of 
infrastructure investment. With [Dr. Vijay Modi](http://modi.mech.columbia.edu) 
of Columbia University.

### Climate System Dynamics
Constructed an agent-based model examining dynamics of coupled human-climate 
system over long timescales. With [Dr. Brad 
Werner](http://complex-systems.ucsd.edu) of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography.
