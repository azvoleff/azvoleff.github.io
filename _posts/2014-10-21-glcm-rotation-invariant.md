This post outlines how to use the `glcm` package to calculate image textures 
that are direction invariant (calculated over "all directions"). This feature 
is only available in `glcm` versions >= 1.0.

## Getting started

First use `devtools` to install the development version of `glcm` from github, 
then load the installed `glcm` package and the `raster` package that is also 
needed for this example:


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("glcm")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Installing package into 'C:/Users/azvoleff/R/win-library/3.1'
## (as 'lib' is unspecified)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## package 'glcm' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
## 
## The downloaded binary packages are in
## 	C:\Users\azvoleff\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp0ePuuG\downloaded_packages
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
library(glcm)
library(raster)
{% endhighlight %}

## Calculating rotationally invariant textures

`glcm` supports calculating GLCMs using multiple shift values.  If multiple 
shifts are supplied, `glcm` will calculate each texture statistic using each of 
the specified shifts, and return the mean value of the texture for each pixel.  
In general, I have not found large differences in calculated image textures 
when comparing GLCM textures calculated using a single shift versus calculating 
rotationally invariant textures. However this may not be the case for images 
with strongly directional textures.

To compare for a sample cropped out of a Landsat scene, use the L5TSR_1986 
sample image included in the `glcm` package. This is a section of a 1986 
Landsat 5 image preprocessed to surface reflectance. The image is from the 
[Volc√°n Barva TEAM 
site](http://www.teamnetwork.org/network/sites/volc%C3%A1n-barva).

When `glcm` is run without specifing a shift, the default shift (1, 1) is used 
(90 degrees), with a window size of 3 pixels x 3 pixels:


{% highlight r %}
test_rast <- raster(L5TSR_1986, layer=1)
tex_shift1 <- glcm(test_rast)
plot(tex_shift1)
{% endhighlight %}

To calculate rotationally invariant GLCM textures (over "all directions" in the 
terminology of commonly used remote sensing software), use: `shift=list(c(0,1), 
c(1,1), c(1,0), c(1,-1))`. This will calculate the average GLCM texture using 
shifts of 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees:


{% highlight r %}
tex_all_dir <- glcm(test_rast,
                         shift=list(c(0,1), c(1,1), c(1,0), c(1,-1)))
plot(tex_all_dir)
{% endhighlight %}

To compare the difference between these textures, subtract the textures 
calculated with a 90 degree shift from those calculated using multiple shifts, 
and plot the result:


{% highlight r %}
plot((tex_all_dir - tex_shift1) / tex_all_dir)
{% endhighlight %}

## Computation time

First look at the time difference for calculating a GLCM with only one shift 
versus calculating a rotationally invariant form:


{% highlight r %}
library(microbenchmark)

glcm_one_dir <- function(x) {
    glcm(x)
}

glcm_all_dir <- function(x) {
    glcm(x, shift=list(c(0,1), c(1,1), c(1,0), c(1,-1)))
}

microbenchmark(glcm_one_dir(test_rast), glcm_all_dir(test_rast), times=5)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Unit: seconds
##                     expr      min       lq     mean   median       uq
##  glcm_one_dir(test_rast) 1.086009 1.089937 1.108039 1.110421 1.113594
##  glcm_all_dir(test_rast) 3.985471 4.039177 4.046066 4.061990 4.063386
##       max neval
##  1.140236     5
##  4.080307     5
{% endhighlight %}

As seen in the above, there is a performance penalty for using a rotationally 
invariant GLCM (not surprisingly, as more calculations are involved).

Prior to having the ability to use multiple shifts hardcoded in `glcm`, it was 
still possible to calculate rotationally invariant textures using the function.  
However, the calculation had to be done manually, using an approach similar to 
what I do below with `glcm_all_dir_manual`. How much faster is it perform the 
averaging directly in `glcm`?


{% highlight r %}
glcm_all_dir_manual <- function(x) {
    text_0deg <- glcm(x, shift=c(0,1))
    text_45deg <- glcm(x, shift=c(1,1))
    text_90deg <- glcm(x, shift=c(1,0))
    text_135deg <- glcm(x, shift=c(1,-1))
    overlay(text_0deg, text_45deg, text_90deg, text_135deg,
            fun=function(w, x, y, z) {
                return((w + x + y + z) / 4)
            })
}
tex_all_dir_manual <- glcm_all_dir_manual(test_rast)

plot(tex_all_dir_manual)
{% endhighlight %}

![center](/content/2014-10-21-glcm-rotation-invariant/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) 

{% highlight r %}
# Check that the textures match
table(getValues(tex_all_dir_manual) == getValues(tex_all_dir))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## 
##   TRUE 
## 273488
{% endhighlight %}

The time difference isn't that great, but the need for repeated calls to `glcm` 
(with mutiple read/writes to disk for large files) could lead to a more 
substantial advantage for the direct approach with `glcm` than is apparent in 
this simple example. Of course, the manual approach does give more flexibility 
if you need to do other processing (or scaling, etc.) to the textures.

Now run a quick benchmark to compare the two methods of calculating a direction 
invariant texture:


{% highlight r %}
microbenchmark(glcm_all_dir_manual(test_rast), glcm_all_dir(test_rast), 
               times=5)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Unit: seconds
##                            expr      min       lq     mean   median
##  glcm_all_dir_manual(test_rast) 4.532071 4.560523 4.596713 4.594508
##         glcm_all_dir(test_rast) 4.029776 4.053473 4.094297 4.114519
##        uq      max neval
##  4.628842 4.667621     5
##  4.131253 4.142464     5
{% endhighlight %}

The time taken by the two methods is close, but note that this is a lower limit 
on the difference between the two. For larger rasters that cannot be stored in 
memory, the benefits of handling the mean texture calculation in the native 
GLCM C++ code will be more apparent, as the need for multiple read/writes from 
disk will start to make the "naive" approach .
